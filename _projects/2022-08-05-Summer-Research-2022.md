excerpt: 'I studied the notion of harmonic measure in the plane, its various formulations
involving conformal maps and Brownian motion, culminating in the study of the so-called
conformally balanced trees following work from Professor of mathematics at Stony Brook Christopher
Bishop. This was a very profitable experience as it helped me further refine my analytical
problem-solving and decomposition skills due to the nature of the work in the project. In conjunction
with the above, my my communication and organisational skills were invariably improved as
I engaged in weekly meetings with my supervisor Dr. Cheraghi, wherein I discussed the progress
of the project and received feedback on approaches to obstacles, incorporating said suggestions
into the project. I obtained a lot of insight into the world of academia and the way research is
conducted.'
