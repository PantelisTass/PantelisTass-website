excerpt: 'This was a 2023 summer research project I undertook under the supervision of professor Greg. Pavliotis themed in the mathematical analysis of machine learning learning algorithms. In brief, 


- I studied the existing literature on recent developments in the context of theoretical machine
learning that integrate tools from statistical physics and probability theory, i.e., the
theory of interacting particle systems.

- I analysed the approximation quality and trainability of neural networks using algorithms,
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), informed by such ideas on toy models and
examples with real life examples such as the MNIST digit classification dataset.

- I performed numerical experiments by training neural networks under various circumstances,
thereby graining practical insights and recorded my observations.'
