excerpt: 'This is a report of our group’s (Pantelis Tassopoulos, Michael Pristin, Ronkgai Zhang, Yuhao Liu, Ana
Ciupala) study of Darboux Transformaions and its role
in the spectral analysis of one dimensional Schr¨odinger operators. This method
allows us to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of such an operator via iteration
in an algebraic manner.


We begin with some preliminary theory about the Hilbert spaces and linear
operators of functions thereof. After developing this formalism, we will discuss
successful applications of this approach for three Schr¨odinger equations
(Schr\"{o}dinger operator eigenvalue problems) with the method of Darboux Transformaions,
which are as follows: the simple harmonic oscillator equation, the
equation with reflectionless potential equation, and the equation with Coulomb
potential. These problems have far reaching implications in the field of Quantum
Mechancis and mathematical physics more broadly and are thus of fundamental
physical interest.'
