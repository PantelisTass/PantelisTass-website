<h1>Welcome to my personal webpage!</h1>

My name is Pantelis Tassopoulos, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in Probability Theory at the University of Cambridge (expected completion July 2027), studying a notion of universality encompassing a large class of random growth processes in the plane, namely, KPZ universality, under the supervision of Dr Sourav Sarkar.

My interests are mainly in Probability Theory, Stochastic analysis and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations

Mentors that have guided me through my academic journey so far inlude: Dr. Sourav Sarkar, Dr. Paul Russell, Professor Perla Sousi, Professor Gregorios Pavliotis, Dr. Ajay Chandra, Sr. Pierre-Francois Rodriguez, Professor Igor Krasovsky and Professor Jonathan Mestel.
