My interests are mainly in Probability Theory, Stochastic analysis, Stochastic Partial Differential Equations

I am pursuing a PhD in Probability Theory at the University of Cambridge (expected completion July 2027), studying a notion of universality encompassing a large class of random growth processes in the plane, namely, KPZ universality, under the supervision of Dr Sourav Sarkar.

My mentors include: Dr. Sourav Sarkar, Dr. Paul Russell, Professor Perla Sousi, Gregorios Pavliotis, Ajay Chandra, Pierre-Francois Rodriguez, Igor Krasovsky and Jonathan Mestel.
